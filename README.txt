Make sure that Maven (backend) and NodeJS (Frontend) are installed.

1. Open backend folder and open the project (Recommended IntelliJ)
2. Run the backend.
3. Open the frontend folder and open the project (Recommended Visual Studio Code)
4. Type in the terminal npm start (this should launch the app automatically, but if it doesn't navigate to http://localhost:3000/ with your preferred browser)

Done
